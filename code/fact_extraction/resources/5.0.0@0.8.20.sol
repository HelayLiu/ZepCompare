/**
 * @dev Interface of the ERC20 Permit extension allowing approvals to be made via signatures, as defined in
 * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612[EIP-2612].
 *
 * Adds the {permit} method, which can be used to change an account's ERC20 allowance (see {IERC20-allowance}) by
 * presenting a message signed by the account. By not relying on {IERC20-approve}, the token holder account doesn't
 * need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all.
 *
 * ==== Security Considerations
 *
 * There are two important considerations concerning the use of `permit`. The first is that a valid permit signature
 * expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be
 * considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have
 * built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should
 * take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be
 * generally recommended is:
 *
 * ```solidity
 * function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {
 *     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}
 *     doThing(..., value);
 * }
 *
 * function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {
 *     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);
 *     ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of
 * `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also
 * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).
 *
 * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so
 * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.

/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```solidity
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();
 * }

/**
 * @dev Implementation of the ERC4626 "Tokenized Vault Standard" as defined in
 * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626[EIP-4626].
 *
 * This extension allows the minting and burning of "shares" (represented using the ERC20 inheritance) in exchange for
 * underlying "assets" through standardized {deposit}, {mint}, {redeem} and {burn} workflows. This contract extends
 * the ERC20 standard. Any additional extensions included along it would affect the "shares" token represented by this
 * contract and not the "assets" token which is an independent contract.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * In empty (or nearly empty) ERC-4626 vaults, deposits are at high risk of being stolen through frontrunning
 * with a "donation" to the vault that inflates the price of a share. This is variously known as a donation or inflation
 * attack and is essentially a problem of slippage. Vault deployers can protect against this attack by making an initial
 * deposit of a non-trivial amount of the asset, such that price manipulation becomes infeasible. Withdrawals may
 * similarly be affected by slippage. Users can protect against this attack as well as unexpected slippage in general by
 * verifying the amount received is as expected, using a wrapper that performs these checks such as
 * https://github.com/fei-protocol/ERC4626#erc4626router-and-base[ERC4626Router].
 *
 * Since v4.9, this implementation uses virtual assets and shares to mitigate that risk. The `_decimalsOffset()`
 * corresponds to an offset in the decimal representation between the underlying asset's decimals and the vault
 * decimals. This offset also determines the rate of virtual shares to virtual assets in the vault, which itself
 * determines the initial exchange rate. While not fully preventing the attack, analysis shows that the default offset
 * (0) makes it non-profitable, as a result of the value being captured by the virtual shares (out of the attacker's
 * donation) matching the attacker's expected gains. With a larger offset, the attack becomes orders of magnitude more
 * expensive than it is profitable. More details about the underlying math can be found
 * xref:erc4626.adoc#inflation-attack[here].
 *
 * The drawback of this approach is that the virtual shares do capture (a very small) part of the value being accrued
 * to the vault. Also, if the vault experiences losses, the users try to exit the vault, the virtual shares and assets
 * will cause the first user to exit to experience reduced losses in detriment to the last users that will experience
 * bigger losses. Developers willing to revert back to the pre-v4.9 behavior just need to override the
 * `_convertToShares` and `_convertToAssets` functions.
 *
 * To learn more, check out our xref:ROOT:erc4626.adoc[ERC-4626 guide].

 * configured by admins (`ADMIN_ROLE` members) after a delay (see {getTargetAdminDelay}).
 *
 * For each target contract, admins can configure the following without any delay:
 *
 * * The target's {AccessManaged-authority} via {updateAuthority}.
 * * Close or open a target via {setTargetClosed} keeping the permissions intact.
 * * The roles that are allowed (or disallowed) to call a given function (identified by its selector) through {setTargetFunctionRole}.
 *
 * By default every address is member of the `PUBLIC_ROLE` and every target function is restricted to the `ADMIN_ROLE` until configured otherwise.
 * Additionally, each role has the following configuration options restricted to this manager's admins:
 *
 * * A role's admin role via {setRoleAdmin} who can grant or revoke roles.
 * * A role's guardian role via {setRoleGuardian} who's allowed to cancel operations.
 * * A delay in which a role takes effect after being granted through {setGrantDelay}.
 * * A delay of any target's admin action via {setTargetAdminDelay}.
 * * A role label for discoverability purposes with {labelRole}.
 *
 * Any account can be added and removed into any number of these roles by using the {grantRole} and {revokeRole} functions
 * restricted to each role's admin (see {getRoleAdmin}).
 *
 * Since all the permissions of the managed system can be modified by the admins of this instance, it is expected that
 * they will be highly secured (e.g., a multisig or a well-configured DAO).
 *
 * NOTE: This contract implements a form of the {IAuthority} interface, but {canCall} has additional return data so it
 * doesn't inherit `IAuthority`. It is however compatible with the `IAuthority` interface since the first 32 bytes of
 * the return data are a boolean as expected by that interface.
 *
 * NOTE: Systems that implement other access control mechanisms (for example using {Ownable}) can be paired with an
 * {AccessManager} by transferring permissions (ownership in the case of {Ownable}) directly to the {AccessManager}.
 * Users will be able to interact with these contracts through the {execute} function, following the access rules
 * registered in the {AccessManager}. Keep in mind that in that context, the msg.sender seen by restricted functions
 * will be {AccessManager} itself.
 *
 * WARNING: When granting permissions over an {Ownable} or {AccessControl} contract to an {AccessManager}, be very
 * mindful of the danger associated with functions such as {{Ownable-renounceOwnership}} or
 * {{AccessControl-renounceRole}}.

 * @dev https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712[EIP 712] is a standard for hashing and signing of typed structured data.
 *
 * The encoding scheme specified in the EIP requires a domain separator and a hash of the typed structured data, whose
 * encoding is very generic and therefore its implementation in Solidity is not feasible, thus this contract
 * does not implement the encoding itself. Protocols need to implement the type-specific encoding they need in order to
 * produce the hash of their typed data using a combination of `abi.encode` and `keccak256`.
 *
 * This contract implements the EIP 712 domain separator ({_domainSeparatorV4}) that is used as part of the encoding
 * scheme, and the final step of the encoding to obtain the message digest that is then signed via ECDSA
 * ({_hashTypedDataV4}).
 *
 * The implementation of the domain separator was designed to be as efficient as possible while still properly updating
 * the chain id to protect against replay attacks on an eventual fork of the chain.
 *
 * NOTE: This contract implements the version of the encoding known as "v4", as implemented by the JSON RPC method
 * https://docs.metamask.io/guide/signing-data.html[`eth_signTypedDataV4` in MetaMask].
 *
 * NOTE: In the upgradeable version of this contract, the cached values will correspond to the address, and the domain
 * separator of the implementation contract. This will cause the {_domainSeparatorV4} function to always rebuild the
 * separator from the immutable values, which is cheaper than accessing a cached version in cold storage.

 * @dev A forwarder compatible with ERC2771 contracts. See {ERC2771Context}.
 *
 * This forwarder operates on forward requests that include:
 *
 * * `from`: An address to operate on behalf of. It is required to be equal to the request signer.
 * * `to`: The address that should be called.
 * * `value`: The amount of native token to attach with the requested call.
 * * `gas`: The amount of gas limit that will be forwarded with the requested call.
 * * `nonce`: A unique transaction ordering identifier to avoid replayability and request invalidation.
 * * `deadline`: A timestamp after which the request is not executable anymore.
 * * `data`: Encoded `msg.data` to send with the requested call.
 *
 * Relayers are able to submit batches if they are processing a high volume of requests. With high
 * throughput, relayers may run into limitations of the chain such as limits on the number of
 * transactions in the mempool. In these cases the recommendation is to distribute the load among
 * multiple accounts.
 *
 * NOTE: Batching requests includes an optional refund for unused `msg.value` that is achieved by
 * performing a call with empty calldata. While this is within the bounds of ERC-2771 compliance,
 * if the refund receiver happens to consider the forwarder a trusted forwarder, it MUST properly
 * handle `msg.data.length == 0`. `ERC2771Context` in OpenZeppelin Contracts versions prior to 4.9.3
 * do not handle this properly.
 *
 * ==== Security Considerations
 *
 * If a relayer submits a forward request, it should be willing to pay up to 100% of the gas amount
 * specified in the request. This contract does not implement any kind of retribution for this gas,
 * and it is assumed that there is an out of band incentive for relayers to pay for execution on
 * behalf of signers. Often, the relayer is operated by a project that will consider it a user
 * acquisition cost.
 *
 * By offering to pay for gas, relayers are at risk of having that gas used by an attacker toward
 * some other purpose that is not aligned with the expected out of band incentives. If you operate a
 * relayer, consider whitelisting target contracts and function selectors. When relaying ERC-721 or
 * ERC-1155 transfers specifically, consider rejecting the use of the `data` field, since it can be
 * used to execute arbitrary code.

 * The full history of delegate votes is tracked on-chain so that governance protocols can consider votes as distributed

 * cost of this history tracking optional.

 * @dev This module connects a {Governor} instance to an {AccessManager} instance, allowing the governor to make calls

 * operations that are not delayed externally by the manager. Execution of a proposal will be delayed as much as
 * necessary to meet the required delays of all of its operations.
 *
 * This extension allows the governor to hold and use its own assets and permissions, unlike {GovernorTimelockControl}
 * and {GovernorTimelockCompound}, where the timelock is a separate contract that must be the one to hold assets and
 * permissions. Operations that are delay-restricted by the manager, however, will be executed through the
 * {AccessManager-execute} function.
 *
 * ==== Security Considerations
 *
 * Some operations may be cancelable in the `AccessManager` by the admin or a set of guardians, depending on the
 * restricted function being invoked. Since proposals are atomic, the cancellation by a guardian of a single operation
 * in a proposal will cause all of the proposal to become unable to execute. Consider proposing cancellable operations
 * separately.
 *
 * By default, function calls will be routed through the associated `AccessManager` whenever it claims the target
 * function to be restricted by it. However, admins may configure the manager to make that claim for functions that a
 * governor would want to call directly (e.g., token transfers) in an attempt to deny it access to those functions. To
 * mitigate this attack vector, the governor is able to ignore the restrictions claimed by the `AccessManager` using
 * {setAccessManagerIgnored}. While permanent denial of service is mitigated, temporary DoS may still be technically
 * possible. All of the governor's own functions (e.g., {setBaseDelaySeconds}) ignore the `AccessManager` by default.

/**
 * @dev This contract implements a proxy that is upgradeable through an associated {ProxyAdmin} instance.
 *
 * To avoid https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/malicious-backdoors-in-ethereum-proxies-62629adf3357[proxy selector
 * clashing], which can potentially be used in an attack, this contract uses the
 * https://blog.openzeppelin.com/the-transparent-proxy-pattern/[transparent proxy pattern]. This pattern implies two
 * things that go hand in hand:
 *
 * 1. If any account other than the admin calls the proxy, the call will be forwarded to the implementation, even if
 * that call matches the {ITransparentUpgradeableProxy-upgradeToAndCall} function exposed by the proxy itself.
 * 2. If the admin calls the proxy, it can call the `upgradeToAndCall` function but any other call won't be forwarded to
 * the implementation. If the admin tries to call a function on the implementation it will fail with an error indicating
 * the proxy admin cannot fallback to the target implementation.
 *
 * These properties mean that the admin account can only be used for upgrading the proxy, so it's best if it's a
 * dedicated account that is not used for anything else. This will avoid headaches due to sudden errors when trying to
 * call a function from the proxy implementation. For this reason, the proxy deploys an instance of {ProxyAdmin} and
 * allows upgrades only if they come through it. You should think of the `ProxyAdmin` instance as the administrative
 * interface of the proxy, including the ability to change who can trigger upgrades by transferring ownership.
 *
 * NOTE: The real interface of this proxy is that defined in `ITransparentUpgradeableProxy`. This contract does not
 * inherit from that interface, and instead `upgradeToAndCall` is implicitly implemented using a custom dispatch
 * mechanism in `_fallback`. Consequently, the compiler will not produce an ABI for this contract. This is necessary to
 * fully implement transparency without decoding reverts caused by selector clashes between the proxy and the
 * implementation.
 *
 * NOTE: This proxy does not inherit from {Context} deliberately. The {ProxyAdmin} of this contract won't send a
 * meta-transaction in any way, and any other meta-transaction setup should be made in the implementation contract.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This contract avoids unnecessary storage reads by setting the admin only during construction as an
 * immutable variable, preventing any changes thereafter. However, the admin slot defined in ERC-1967 can still be
 * overwritten by the implementation logic pointed to by this proxy. In such cases, the contract may end up in an
 * undesirable state where the admin slot is different from the actual admin.
 *
 * WARNING: It is not recommended to extend this contract to add additional external functions. If you do so, the
 * compiler will not check that there are no selector conflicts, due to the note above. A selector clash between any new
 * function and the functions declared in {ITransparentUpgradeableProxy} will be resolved in favor of the new one. This
 * could render the `upgradeToAndCall` function inaccessible, preventing upgradeability and compromising transparency.
