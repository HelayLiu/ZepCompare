 * Bouncer addresses can be individual servers signing grants or different
 * users within a decentralized club that have permission to invite other members.
 * This technique is useful for whitelists and airdrops; instead of putting all
 * valid addresses on-chain, simply sign a grant of the form
 * keccak256(abi.encodePacked(`:contractAddress` + `:granteeAddress`)) using a valid bouncer address.
 * Then restrict access to your crowdsale/whitelist/airdrop using the
 * `onlyValidSignature` modifier (or implement your own using isValidSignature).
 * In addition to `onlyValidSignature`, `onlyValidSignatureAndMethod` and
 * `onlyValidSignatureAndData` can be used to restrict access to only a given method
 * or a given method with given parameters respectively.
 * See the tests Bouncer.test.js for specific usage examples.
 * @notice A method that uses the `onlyValidSignatureAndData` modifier must make the _sig
 * parameter the "last" parameter. You cannot sign a message that has its own
 * signature in it so the last 128 bytes of msg.data (which represents the
 * length of the _sig data and the _sig data itself) is ignored when validating.
