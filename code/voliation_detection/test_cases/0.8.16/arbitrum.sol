/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();
 * }
 * ```

     * - the caller must have the TIMELOCK_ADMIN_ROLE role.
     *
     * This function is override to preserve the invariants that all changes to the system
     * must do a round trip, and must be executed from an UpgradeExecutor. The overriden function
     * only allows delay to be set by address(this). This is done by creating a proposal that has
     * address(this) as its target, and call updateDelay upon execution. This would mean that a
     * proposal could set the delay directly on the timelock, without originating from an UpgradeExecutor.
     * Here we override the the function and only allow it to be set by the timelock admin
     * which is expected to be the UpgradeExecutor to avoid the above scenario.
     *
     * It should be noted that although the avoided scenario does break the invariants we wish to
     * maintain, it doesn't pose a security risk as the proposal would still have to go through one timelock to change
     * the delay, and then future proposals would still need to go through the other timelocks.
     * So upon seeing the proposal to change the timelock users would still need to intiate their exits
     * before the timelock duration has passed, which is the same requirement we have for proposals
     * that properly do round trips.
